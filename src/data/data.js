        question: "Does this gift could actually boost my child interested in reading?",
        answer: "When children see themselves in stories, it can help build their self-efficacy—a belief in their abilities to achieve goals. According to a study by Bandura (1997), when children identify with characters who embody determination and resilience, they are more likely to internalize these qualities and pursue their dreams.",
        additionalInfo:"A study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that personalized content can improve students' reading motivation and comprehension (Schneider et al., 2002). This engagement fosters a love for reading, which is essential for developing literacy skills and igniting passions."
